`CyberEnvVisual.py` is the application implementation for the Simpy based Cyber RL environment. The IEEE 123 bus case is divided into 7 zones. Within each zones there is a `data concentrator` shown in red node, the green node is the `DSO`, while all the blue nodes are the `Routers` represent the hybrid topology.
